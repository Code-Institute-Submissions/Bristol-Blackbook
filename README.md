# Bristol Blackbook

#### A Full Stack website allowing users to manage a common dataset documenting Bristol's underground Graffiti Scene.

Bristol has one of the most prolific and active graffiti scenes in the UK. The Bristol Blackbook serves to allow users to witness the styles seen on the streets of Bristol, most of which get erased within a matter of days, never to be seen again... Whether you are a part of the local culture or not, everyone should be given access to appreciate this city's underground urban artform, as well as the skill of all Bristol writers and crews putting in the work and getting up...

##### This project was developed for my Data Centric Development project on my Full Stack Software Development course.

## 1 UX

### 1.1 Overview

Bristol Blackbook was built off the idea of creating a database to document the urban artform of graffiti found on the streets of Bristol city. Often most artists upload these images to Instagram under private accounts, restricted for anonymity. This means most people cannot see them, so I wanted to create a website that maintained this idea of user privacy and was not associated with any social media platforms. This allows users to anonymously view and contribute to the content.

### 1.2 Project Goals

visually pleaseing 
easy for users to navigate
explains its purpose

- The site must clearly display its purpose.
- Display images effectively.
- Categorise works by artist.
- Artists assigned to crews

### 1.3 User Stories

When creating my user stories, I tried to implement the principles of Bill Wake's INVEST nmemomic for each one.
- Independant
- Negotiable
- Valuable
- Estimatable
- Small
- Testable

**User Stories**

When necessary, I wanted to break stories down into smaller related epics.

- UX
    - As a developer, I want my site to have a clearly defined purpose so users are aware of the sites functionality, maintaining a good user experience.
    - As a developer, I want each of my features to have effective functionality so that users are not given an unpleasent experience.

- User Accounts:
    - As a designer, I want users to register for an account so that I can personalise their experience.
    - As a developer, I want users to register for an account so that I can implement user authentication, preventing unauthorised editing and deletion of data.
    - As a registered user, I want control over my account, so that I can easily choose to delete the account or any content I have uploaded to the website.

- Database Content
    - As a designer, I want each work to display correct info, so that users to be able to clearly find the artist, style, year and type.
    - As a designer, I want to display all content relating to each artist, crew, style or type, so that users are able to easily navigate and view this content.
    - As a user, I want to see how to add content, so that I can easily contribute to the database.

### **Development Stages**

This project was designed using an agile approach, utilisng a Kanban board to track my development progress throughout the build. You can view the board I created using Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/mH8fpkjQ/milestone-project-3).

## 3 Technologies Used

### 3.1 Languages

### [**HTML/HTML 5**](https://html.com/html5/)

HTML5 is a Hyper Text Markup Language. Roughly 16% of my code was the HTML file [index.html](index.html) as it was used to create the structured content and elements essential to build the game.

### [**CSS/CSS3**](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)

CSS is a Cascading Style Sheet and was implemented via the [styles.css](assets\css\styles.css) file. All of the visible HTML content was positioned and styled using this language, making up roughly 24% of the entire code.

### [**JavaScript ES6**](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_es6.asp)

ECMAScript 6 - ECMAScript 2015, otherwise known as JavaScript 6, was used to write all of the functionality and game mechanics within this project. Around 60% of the entire code was JavaScript, which was used heavily with the Canvas API.

### [**Python**](https://www.python.org/)

### 3.2 Libraries

### [**Flask**]()
### [**PyMongo**]()
### [**Jinja**]()
### [**BSON**]()
### [**Werkzeug Security**]()
### [**MongoDB Atlas**]()
### [**MD Bootstrap**]()
### [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/)

Font Awesome 4.7.0 was used for the GitHub social and audio mute icons.

### [**Google Fonts API**](https://fonts.google.com/)

All of the fonts used within this project were provided by the Google Fonts API. The fonts used were 'Audiowide' 'Oxanium', and 'Orbitron'.

### 3.3 Tools

### [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Visual Studio Code was the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to write the code for this project.

### [**Chrome DevTools**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)

The Chrome DevTools were used a lot in the development of this project to live preview edits and diagnose problems. I also ran lots of auditing and testing using built in tools such as Sources, Lighthouse and Coverage.

### [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)

Git was used for version control with GitHub - commiting each development stage to the GitHub repository.

### [**Github**](https://github.com/)

GitHub was used to host the repository.

### [**GNU Image Manipulation Program**](https://www.gimp.org/)

GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) was used to create the favicon website icon.
